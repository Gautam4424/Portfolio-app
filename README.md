# Portfolio-app🌐 Portfolio Website (HTML, CSS, Responsive Design)

This is my personal portfolio website, built from scratch using HTML , CSS and javascript. 💻 I focused on creating a fully responsive design to ensure that the website is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, providing a seamless experience for visitors. 📱💻 The website showcases my skills, projects, and experience in the world of web development. 🚀
